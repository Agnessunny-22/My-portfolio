  <h1>Project 2 - Leftover Food App Interface</h1>
  <p>This project is an app interface designed in Figma during my 1st semester for the subject “Design and Engineering.”</p>
  <p>The goal of the app is to help restaurants sell leftover food at a lower price, reducing food waste and benefiting people looking for affordable meals.</p>
  <p>I designed the interface focusing on user simplicity and clean navigation.</p>
  <p>Here is a screenshot of the app design:</p>
